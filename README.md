# BrainFlix

BrainFlix is the fourth project in the BrainStation curriculum, spanning three weeks, with each week representing a dedicated sprint. These weeks were allocated to specific tasks, including the creation and styling of HTML elements, ensuring responsiveness across a range of screen widths from 320px to 1920px, and establishing the connection between the front-end and back-end. The project concluded at the end of the eighth week of the bootcamp. By this point, I was exposed to HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, React, Node and Express.

The website was designed to be responsive and adapt its layout based on three distinct screen sizes:

- Less than 786 pixels: Mobile formatting is applied.
- Between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels: Tablet formatting is utilized.
- More than 1280 pixels: Desktop formatting is implemented.

Technologies and npm packages used:

- Express
- CORS
- Nodemon
- dotenv

The frontend of this website can be seen in the following repository:
